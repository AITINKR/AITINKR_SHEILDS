## AITINKR_SHEILDS
Aitinkr Sheilds are used that aims to create an easy-to-use feature for the Arduino Uno.
A simple yet powerful shields to enhance the capabilities of Arduino. Mounts exactly on Arduino to save space. Easy to connect wide range of sensors and modules.
# AITINKR_SHEILD_V1
The AitinKr Shield V1 is designed specifically for the Arduino UNO and provides you 6 off 3-PIN Analog inputs, 3 off 4-PIN Analog inputs,6 off servo connectors, 4 off 2-PIN motor BO motor connectors,1 off stepper motor connector, motor driver, blue tooth module connector, I2C pins, DC jack for external power supply and 3-PIN battery connector.
# AITINKR_SHEILD_V2
The AitinKr Shield V2 is designed specifically for the Arduino UNO and provides you 7 off 3-PIN Analog inputs, 3 off 4-PIN Analog inputs,4 off servo connectors, 4 off 2-PIN motor BO motor connectors,1 off stepper motor connector, motor driver, blue tooth module connector, I2C pins, DC jack for external power supply and 3-PIN battery connector.
# AITINKR_SHEILDS_LIBRARY
The library is designed to work with the AitinKr Shields V1 and V2, which can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/AITINKR/AITINKR_SHEILDS
This library have its unique functionalities to work with AitinKr Shields V1 and V2.So, sheilds can be connected on top of arduino uno as an addon which makes easy to connect wide range of sensors and modules.And, it makes easy to code.
